# 🌍 Solar System 3D Simulation

## 📌 Overview
Developed a **realistic 3D simulation** of planetary movements, incorporating physics-based orbital mechanics and interactive camera controls to enhance user experience.

## 🎯 Features
- **Realistic Planetary Orbits** – Simulated planetary motion based on orbital mechanics.
- **3D Object Transformations** – Implemented movement, rotation, and scaling using **Linear Algebra**.
- **Adjustable Camera Controls** – Enabled smooth user navigation with interactive camera movements.
- **Real-Time Rendering** – Optimized OpenGL rendering for smooth animations and realistic effects.
- **Shader-Based Lighting** – Used GLSL shaders for dynamic lighting, reflections, and shadows.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Graphics API:** OpenGL  
- **Shader Language:** GLSL  
- **Math Library:** GLM  
- **Window & Input Handling:** GLFW  

## 🛠️ Development Environment
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
